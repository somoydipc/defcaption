- `FORCESUB`: Before starting building bots create a public channel and get the username without '@'Make bot admin in that channel.

- `LOG_GROUP`: Get is by copying any post link and extract value just after `https:t.me/c/` and next `/` then after put `-100` before it. Make bot ADMIN in that channel or group.

Removed unwanted behaviour of MONGO_DB
